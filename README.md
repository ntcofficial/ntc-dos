Disk Operating System that I use only for me! (Listen, its not really an os, its just a batch script, but nevertheless, its onnly used to give vibes and nothing else...)

## latest version: v1.6.28.0.3
- Added Changelog feature
- Added a working custom command -- "ntc-go", compared to "start" in batch.
